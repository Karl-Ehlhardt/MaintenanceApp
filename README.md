# Eleven Fifty Academy Blue Badge Final Project

## Machine Maintenance App

This is an API that will allow users to assign, track, and manage machine maintenance.

The API allows for CRUD methods for the following items:

* Machines
* Areas within those machines
* Machines within those areas
* Tasks needed on those machines
* Users assigned to those tasks

The permissions are set-up so that Users can see everything, but only Admins who have been added to the Admins table can create, update, or delete buildings, areas, machines, or tasks.
