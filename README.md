# Eleven Fifty Academy Blue Badge Final Project

## Machine Maintenance App

Please visit our [Trello planning board.](https://trello.com/b/9VHzjxGe/machine-maintenance "Machine Maintenance on Trello")

This is an API that will allow users to assign, track, and manage machine maintenance.

The API allows for Admin access to CRUD methods for the following items:

* Machines
* Areas within those machines
* Machines within those areas
* Tasks needed on those machines
* Assign a user to those tasks

It also allows Users to see all objects and dpdate a task that is completed. 

By setting up an extra Admin table, we were able to ensure that users cannot remove or pass off a task that has been assigned to them, but they can check off tasks as completed.
