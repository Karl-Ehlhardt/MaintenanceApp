# Eleven Fifty Academy Blue Badge Final Project

## Machine Maintenance App

This is an API that will allow users to assign, track, and manage machine maintenance.

The API allows for Admin access to CRUD methods for the following items:

* Machines
* Areas within those machines
* Machines within those areas
* Tasks needed on those machines
* Assign a user to those tasks

It also allows Users to Update a task that is completed. 

The permissions are set-up so that Users can see everything, but only Admins who have been added to the Admins table can create, update, or delete buildings, areas, machines, or tasks.
